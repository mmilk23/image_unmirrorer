The **Image Unmirrorer** 

This project provides a set of APIs for image manipulation and processing, currently under active development. The /mirror endpoint allows users to upload an image and receive a horizontally mirrored version, while the /grayscale endpoint returns a grayscale version of the uploaded image.

Developed in Elixir and containerized with Docker, the project is easy to set up and deploy. It serves as an excellent example application for newcomers to Elixir programming, demonstrating fundamental concepts in API design and image processing.

## Features
- Mirrors/grayscale uploaded images (supports JPEG and PNG formats).
- Easy integration via RESTful API.

   mix run --no-halt
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

## API Endpoints
- **POST /mirror**: Receives an image and returns its horizontally mirrored version.
- **POST /grayscale**: Receives an image and returns a grayscale version of the image.
- **GET /openapi.json**: Provides the OpenAPI specification for the API.


### Example Request
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/mirror -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @your_image.jpg -o image-mirror.jpg
```

## Testing
You can test the application by accessing the `testmirror.html` file in your browser:
```
http://localhost:4000/testmirror.html
http://localhost:4000/testgrayscale.html
```

Alternatively, you can use a CURL command:
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @your_image.jpg http://localhost:4000/mirror --output image-mirror.jpg
```

To run coverage tests:
```sh
mix test --cover
```
